**Questions that are asked often**

What is the stock boost pattern?

Stock boost should be 10-8-10psi dipping during turbo transition on 13B, on 20B... (TBC)

How do I plumb in a boost controller?

The stock boost solenoid is located on the bottom of the 90' pipe leading to the throttle body. You can't miss it - it also is what the ignition leads are mounted to. This is a good place to add your MAC valve within the factory plumbing.
