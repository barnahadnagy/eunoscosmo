**Questions that are asked often**

What is the stock boost pattern?

Stock boost should be 10-8-10psi dipping during turbo transition on 13B, on 20B... (TBC)

How does the stock turbo control work?

It is very similar to the FD RX7 with some small changes. See this awesome classic write-up:

How do I plumb in a boost controller?

The stock boost solenoid is located on the bottom of the 90' pipe leading to the throttle body. You can't miss it - it also is what the ignition leads are mounted to. This is a good place to add your MAC valve within the factory plumbing.
