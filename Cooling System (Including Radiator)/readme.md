**Cosmo cooling system**

To start, Another quite unique thing to this car is the dual thermostats. 20B Cosmos have an additional coolant thermoswitch next to the secondary (A/C) fan thermoswitch which goes to the gearbox computer when temperatures >108c. 13B do not have this second thermoswitch.

Here a photo of my 13B thermostat housing with the single thermoswitch:

This thermoswitch is normally closed, and opens when temperatures >102c. This will then turn on the small fan mounted to the radiator inside the shroud for the clutch fan,when either the A/C or the ECU switch their side of the relay on. This fan will not turn on unless both the thermoswitch is kicked, and the A/c OR the ECU requests it.

Here is a photo of my 13B with a EFR9174 retaining the clutch fan and small fan. I had to make a tough choice here, I wanted to be able to duct to the turbo inlet but the fan and shroud were too close (closer than the pictures look)

This clutch fan is awesome, if you can keep it do it! 99% of driving you will never hear this small fan kick on as the clutch fan even idling moves a lot of air for the radiator and A/C. However, if you would like to control this fan via a switch or an aftermarket ECU, you can pull the plug from the thermoswitch which makes its control 100% dependant on A/C or the ECU ground output.

I didn't get a photo of the small fan mounted inside the shroud but you will get a general idea:

**Thermostats**

The two thermostats from factory in this housing are 82c, and 97c. One of the thermostats is blocked off via an actuator, which I discovered is vacuum actuated closed and normally-open. This actuator is then vented to atmosphere when the ECU commands the small fan on (its the same relay system).

If you connect the above vacuum port to the intake manifold directly, at hot idle conditions when your thermostat is most likely working harder you are keeping the actuator closed which I found out the hard way that my 97c thermostat was in the "main" position, and I couldn't get coolant temps below that unless I was in boost.

Solution?

Replace both thermostats with 82c Tridon (or other brand) FD thermostats. This is a good idea even on a 100% stock car.
