**Suspension:**

The suspension on this car is interesting. On some models (SX, S) there is an additional rear helper strut:

This shock can be removed if moving to aftermarket suspension although I have found with BC Golds retaining is firm, but not too bad.

**Upgrading to aftermarket suspension**

This is the height difference between BC Golds, and the stock SX shocks

There is a **big difference** between series 1 and series 2 Cosmos when installing these. Series 2 (which have normal 3 point belts instead of lap belts) in the rear will make it very difficult to tune your rear suspension with the rear seatbelts installed. 

You cannot run the adjustment extender, as the seatbelts mount to the rear strut mount!

On Series 1 this is just empty parcel tray and an extender fits through without issues. There may be a mounting point on the C pillar for these belts (as a lot of the Australian cars with lap belt conversions use these) but I need someone to confirm for me.
