From Simon Gallant on the Cosmo Owners Group:

Alternative Toyota part number for this: 83181-20040


Many hours of flicking through parts catalogues, all made possible by the invaluable wiring book from 
Travis Sherwood. 

On the top is the complete Cosmo speed sensor assembly. The bottom half is just an adaptor, the top bit unscrews.

In the middle is the unscrewed top half.

On the bottom is the speed sensor from an 80 series Landcruiser.

Verified with a super dodgy adapter harness and a drill. Speedo shows exactly the same km/h reading for the same drill speed as the factory one. Tested at both low (speedo value around 40km/h) and high (speedo value 130km/h). Vid coming in comments. 

Only problem is the plug is different.

To swap the plugs you'll need a small sharp object (gasket pick etc) and a small flat screwdriver. The Cosmo plug has an orange cap - pull this out.

With the orange cap out, you'll see a retaining clip on each side of the metal connectors. Gently lift these (or break them ðŸ˜‚) and pull the connectors out the back of the plug.

You now have three wires. One is black (-ve), one is black with a yellow stripe (+12v), one is white (signal).
These connectors have nasty little tabs on them. You need to fold these in so they are flat.

Carefully shove the connectors into your new plug. - ve goes in the middle. Signal goes in the side with the sticking out tang bit. If you're lucky, the new sensor has labels on the pins (P, -, +) and you can double check everything as you go.

You need to orient the connectors correctly - they have a divot in one side. The plug has a bit that clips into that. If you get out right, you'll get a teeny click when fully seated.
Once fully seated, push the insulators into the back of the plug. If, like me, you damaged these, you need to swear a couple of times and then wrap the whole thing in electrical tape to waterproof it.
Plug swap DONE!
Now you want to plug onto the new sensor and test it. Use a drill to hold the bit of metal that rotates so you can spin up the sensor.
Turn the car on (don't start it, just 'on'), stick it in Neutral, LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN, jump under the car and spin up the sensor with the drill. You left the door open, right? Because if you've done everything right, the doors just locked! Put everything back together - job done.

Oh, and if your car is like mine, you needed to remove the exhaust, heat shield, and transmission mount to get to the sensor.
And also, if your car is like mine you've now discovered that your transmission mount is wrecked AND your shift linkages are loose. Fix this stuff! (I have a trans mounts coming soon, I hope).
