**Testing for Transmission Fault codes:**

Testing for stock transmission computer fault codes is quite simple. With the ignition off, in the engine bay near the battery there is a Diagnostic plug. Get a paperclip or a short peice of wire, and short the TAT and Ground pins together (Depicted here in Blue)

Turn the ignition on, and you will see the Hold light on the dash flash. If this stays off, it means there are no codes. If it flashes a sequence, it means the following:

Long flash is the first number, then short flashes are the second number. 

For example, code 6 for Speed sensor will flash 6 quick flashes, then a 4 second period before it repeats like this: _-_-_-_-_-_-______ 

A code 12 for Throttle Sensor will flash 1 long flash, and 2 short flashes, then a 4 second period before it repeats like this: _---_-_-_____

If there are multiple codes, it will do the smallest number first.

The list of codes are below. They are either if the circuit is open (unplugged) or shorted, there isn't any further logic or diagnostics in this simple system.

0: Normal

1: Engine RPM signal (Ignitor)

6: Speed Sensor 1

7: Speed Sensor 

12: Throttle Sensor

56: Transmission Temp sensor

57: Torque down/torque down request signal (goes to ECU)

60: Shift Solenoid A

61: Shift Solenoid B

62: Overrun Clutch

63: Lock Up Solenoid

64: Line Pressure Solenoid
