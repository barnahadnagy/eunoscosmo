**Wiring in a piggyback ECU to work with the automatic gearbox**

Wiring in a patch harness to an aftermarket ECU (such as a Link, Haltech, MaxxECU, Microtech) is fairly simple. 

You will need to run both the stock ECU, and the stock TCU. Currently I am working on emulating the remaining stock ECU pins in order to remove it, and run it with just the TCU. 

The TCU requires the following to be still pinned to the stock ECU (or shared with stock ECU and aftermarket ECU) to keep it from throwing limp mode.
