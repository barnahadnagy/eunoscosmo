The stock CAS needs to be configured as per the below settings:

At the bottom of that screen is the option to turn fuel and ignition off. Tick those boxes and crank the engine while taking a Trigger scope. 

It should look like the below:

Now, turn ignition on but leave fuel off. Here, you need to confirm the timing by setting it to 10* and using the marks on the pulley. Either adjust the CAS physically, or adjust the First Tooth Angle backwards or forwards

See the "how to time the engine" guide. The yellow mark on the pulley is for 5 degrees after TDC. The red mark on the pulley is for the trailing 20 degrees ATDC. 

Depending if you are running wasted spark or not, you can put your timing light on the L1 lead and lock timing to -5 degrees and crank the engine and adjust until it's on the yellow mark notch.

If running wasted spark, use the T1 lead and lock ignition timing to -20 and do the same (best to set your trailing ignition setting to fire simultaniously.
