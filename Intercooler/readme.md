**Intercooler**

To start, the 20B and 13B intercoolers are substantially different. The 20B intercooler is almost 2x thicker with bigger ID/OD piping, and the over-the-radiator pipes are much bigger OD/ID (2.25" vs 2.75" ID) and shorter on the 20B cars as well as made from cast metal. Here's some photos of the differences in the pipes:

The standard 13B accordion connectors that go from the turbos to the intercooler pipes aren't long enough to reach the 20B intercooler pipes if you change the intercooler and pipes to 20B.

**Aftermarket Intercooler**

If you are wanting to upgrade your intercooler and retain the over-the-radiator pipes, A/C and factory rad system there is quite a bit of space on the front. If you are retaining the factory transmission cooler and oil coolers if you want the biggest radiator possible, you'll need to have them on a 90 off the back of the tanks between the intercooler and radiator, as they are in the way.

On my car, I have added a VinnyFab intercooler which was based on a vmount FD intercooler which I sent them the dimensions for (I believe they now sell these for Cosmos). This intercool has provided my EFR9174 with great IATs with little restriction.

You could connect it to the overradiator piping with some simple fabrication or dodgy silicon (Like I did), and the only thing that you need to modify on the car is remove the front tow hook and move the horn and A/C temp sensor bracket slightly out of the way.

Its dimensions are the following to fit on the factory mounts without needing to cut any bumper or support:

450x300x100mm core
270mm between center top mounting bungs
240mm between center of bottom mounting bungs

Here's how it fit:
