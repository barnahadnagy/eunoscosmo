Fuel cradle on these cars is similar to FD RX7. 

A **Walbro GSS342** will drop in on a factory car in the cradle. Will work fine on stock ECU, fuel pressure regulator and wiring provided you run the stock resistor pack or else you will get pressure spikes on the factory fuel pressure regulator at idle and very light cruise.

A **Walbro 400** will also fit with some small modifications, but will require its own relay and decent hard wiring to the battery due to the current draw it will try and pull through your stock 30+ year old wiring. The stock fuel return at this level is pump is very overwhelmed even with a decent fuel pressure regulator. On my Cosmo my 400 records almost 60psi at idle with factory return, dropping to its 3 bar/43psi regulated pressure once load increases.
