**Fuel tank:**

Fuel cradle on these cars is similar to FD RX7. To remove the tank (which is behind the rear passenger seats), ideally run the car low on fuel, then open the boot and remove the boot lining/carpets. You will see the fuel tank there. Unplug the fuel lines, and the electrical connector on the top of the tank. The top hat fittings on the tank will clear the hard fuel lines if you are careful.

There are 2 straps, which when undone will let you remove the tank through the boot. If it is your first time removing this, there is some sticky black glue or something that keeps the tack stuck. This stuff is NASTY if you spill fuel on it and starts melting crap everywhere so be careful. With a pry bar you should be able to separate the tank from the sticky glue.

**Once the tank is out:**

Here's my original fuel pump in the hanger:

A **Walbro GSS342** will drop in on a factory car in the cradle. Will work fine on stock ECU, fuel pressure regulator and wiring provided you run the stock resistor pack or else you will get pressure spikes on the factory fuel pressure regulator at idle and very light cruise.

A **Walbro 400** will also fit with some small modifications, but will require its own relay and decent hard wiring to the battery due to the current draw it will try and pull through your stock 30+ year old wiring. The stock fuel return at this level is pump is very overwhelmed even with a decent fuel pressure regulator. On my Cosmo my 400 records almost 60psi at idle with factory return, dropping to its 3 bar/43psi regulated pressure once load increases.

**fuel sender**

Resistance values of the stock fuel level sender in the workshop manual (section T page 69) are 6ohm full, 95ohm empty
