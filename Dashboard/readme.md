Information on removing the dashboard can be found under the Workshop Manuals part of this wiki - section S page 86.


From David Brereton on the Cosmo Owners Club:


Getting to cluster:

Ok hope this is easy to follow:

1: pull tweeters out of dash top and unplug(undo bolts under them)

2: pull radio and unplug

3: two bolts under covers at the end of top dash

4: top dash will pull off

5: remove glove box and backing cover 

6: remove lower drivers panel(the bit the goes around ignition)

7: undo two nuts holding the wood trim at the ends (the centre of the trim is held in with clips and can be lifted with some gentle force)

8:once that is removed all screws holding the tinted Perspex (undo and carefully pull out)(I pull the bottom out as far as I can then lever the top locators out and wiggle a bit)

9: you now have access to the cluster and is straight forward from there
