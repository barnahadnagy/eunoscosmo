**Stock Turbocharger information**

To clear a myth that is often repeated on forums, the 13B Turbos are not different sizes. Both are HT10 and the same size. I cannot comment on 20B turbos as I haven't removed a set. The turbo control and everything around it are almost the same.

It's possible to remove the turbos while the engine is in the car as the bay is actually pretty big. My first set I removed took most of a day which a lot of involved using penerant (I recommend CRC Pener8 it makes it 100x easier to remove the rusted overheated bolts), now I can probably get a set off in a couple of hours, and back on in the same time.

Here is a set of stock 13B turbos:

Note the center housing clocking being munted. **It is imperative if you are getting your stock turbos rebuilt to physically mark the clocking before they are taken apart or you will in for a world of pain you cannot imagine. I wish I was joking. The rest of the intake piping, oil feed hard lines, drains, and water lines and drains will NOT go in nicely when putting them back on unless it is clocked perfectly.**

Here's some examples if you don't believe me:

Now, the removal of the turbos themselves isn't too difficult. Drain oil and coolant from the car, and work your way from the intercooler piping backwards. If you are planning to put the turbos back on, try not to break the gaskets on the cold side nest of pipes. if you do, gasket paper will work.

The air pump and Air Control Valve (emissions valve located on the Intake manifold the air-pump feeds to) will need to be removed in oder to pull the cold side off. When taking the ACV off, try to undo it at the connector between the firewall and the intake manifold leaving the connector on the valve itself still connected. Unscrewing the wiring at the ACV will cause a tiny little spring and piston inside the wiring connector to go shooting off into space and then your air pump won't work properly.
