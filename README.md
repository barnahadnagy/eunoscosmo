# Eunos Cosmo
A resource for the 1990-1995 Mazda/Eunos Cosmo - technical documentation, how-tos, and information.


All information here was found on various forums, groups, defunct websites, or has been discovered and written by myself or and other contributors. 

Many thanks to the awesome members of the Cosmo Owners Group on Facebook, and Travis Sherwood for his translated Workshop and Wiring manuals which are highly recommended as an owner of this vehicle - if you would like to purchase copies of the translated Workshop Manuals please contact him on fc3ssherwood@gmail.com. 

Free for anyone to use to keep this rare old vehicle alive.
