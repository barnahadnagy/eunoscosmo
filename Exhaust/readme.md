If you are using stock turbos, running a free flowing exhaust (say a 3" or bigger with no catalyst) will cause you to get some serious boost creep eventuating in a nasty boost cut (in my case I had a 3" almost straight through and I would hit boost cut at 150kmh when driving in Mexico. The wastegate on the stock turbos is very very small, and easily overcome. The flap does not have much room to move, no doubt it could be ported but that requires the removal of the turbos.

The flap which controls the secondary turbo boost feeds from the primary and out the same small wastegate. So that small wastegate is bleeding exhaust pressure from 2 turbos.

Here is one with the cover removed. With the cover on, it fouls almost immediately on the cover. This could possibly be ported as well.

**Catalyst removal**

If you decide to go for a test pipe setup, the stock catalyst has a couple of "features" which will need to be addressed. 

One is the air pipe going from the intake manifold into the catalyst which the Air Control Valve feeds from the air pump to assist in catalyst warm up. If this is blocked with the air pump/AVC system still active, it will cause backpressure on the airpump system (killing your airpump and power) and cause exhaust to go into your air filter box through the bypass filling your air filter and ACV with soot. You can see this soot on the left in this photo, the one on the right was from a fully functioning system:

The next thing that will need to be addressed is the catalyst temperature sensor. If this is cut off or removed, you will recieve a warning light on your dashboard and the ECU will run mega rich as it thinks the catalyst is overheating and is trying to cool it down. 

You can cat the temperature sensor off and wire in a 26ohm resistor which is enough to trick the the ECU that everything is a-okay. Keep an eye on boost without a catalyst to make sure you aren't creeping.
