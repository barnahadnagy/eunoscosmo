**Exhaust modification**

If you are using stock turbos, running a free flowing exhaust (say a 3" or bigger with no catalyst) will cause you to get some serious boost creep. The wastegate on the stock turbos is very very small, and easily overcome. The flap does not have much room to move, no doubt it could be ported but that requires the removal of the turbos.

The flap which controls the secondary turbo boost feeds from the primary and out the same small wastegate. So that small wastegate is bleeding exhaust pressure from 2 turbos.

Here is one with the cover removed. With the cover on, it fouls almost immediately on the cover. This could possibly be ported as well.
